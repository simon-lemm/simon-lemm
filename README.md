# 👋 Hi, I'm Simon Lemm

I'm a molecular biologist and bioinformatician with a focus on cancer research, RNA sequencing, and translational medicine. My background spans both wet-lab experiments and computational data analysis, allowing me to bridge the gap between biology and data science.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Tumor immunology & the tumor microenvironment
- RNA-seq & alternative splicing detection
- Workflow automation & reproducible science

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- **Languages**: Python, R, Bash, SQL
- **NGS Analysis**: Snakemake, STAR, SUPPA2, LeafCutter, iREAD, IRFinder-S
- **Environments & Tools**: Conda, Singularity, Git, Galaxy
- **Statistical Analysis**: RStudio, GraphPad Prism

## 📚 Education
- Advanced Training in Applied Bioinformatics & Biostatistics (2024–2025)
- M.Sc. Molecular Biomedicine – HHU Düsseldorf (2020–2023)
- B.Sc. Biotechnology – FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences (2017–2020)
- Apprenticeship in Biology Laboratory Technology – Forschungszentrum Jülich (2014–2017)

## 🧪 Notable Projects
- **Alternative Splicing Detection (Centogene GmbH, 2025)**  
  Developed and benchmarked reproducible RNA-seq pipelines using splicing tools such as SUPPA2, LeafCutter, IRFinder-S, and rMATS.

- **Master’s Thesis: Tumor-Stroma Interaction Affects Neutrophil Biology via IL-1α**  
  Investigated neutrophil recruitment mechanisms in cancer; included confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and statistical evaluation.

## 📄 Poster Contributions
- *Neutrophil 2024 Symposium*: „Tumor-stroma crosstalk shapes the tumor microenvironment and neutrophil recruitment and function“
- *TRR332 Conference 2023 & 2022*: „Tumor microenvironment and neutrophils – partners in cancer progression“, „Deciphering molecular links between the tumor micro-environment and functional plasticity of tumor-associated neutrophils“
